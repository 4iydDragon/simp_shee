# shell_0-1.c
This is just a simple example, and it doesn't support all of the features of a real UNIX command line interpreter. However, it should give you a good starting point for writing your own UNIX command line interpreter.

# argu_0-2.c
This code is more powerful than the previous code because it can handle command lines with arguments. For example, the following command line will print the contents of the file myfile.txt:

Code snippet
cat myfile.txt

The execvp() function is a more powerful version of the execve() function. It takes the name of the command and its arguments as arguments, and it executes the command in the current environment.

This code is more powerful than the previous code because it can handle the “end of file” condition. For example, if the user presses Ctrl+D while the prompt is displayed, the program will print the message "End of file" and exit.


# path_0-3.c

This code is more powerful than the previous code because it can handle the PATH. For example, if the user types the command ls, the program will look for the ls command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. If the ls command is found, the program will execute it. If the ls command is not found, the program will print an error message.


# exit_0-4.c

This code is more powerful than the previous code because it can handle the PATH, and it also has an exit built-in. For example, if the user types the command ls, the program will look for the ls command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable. If the ls command is found, the program will execute it. If the ls command is not found, the program will print an error message. If the user types the command exit, the program will exit without executing any command.
